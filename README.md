Repetible-Research Generic Python Project
=========================================

#### Manifesto

Because *Human* is **perfectible** and **error-prone**, because *Science* should be **open** and **flow** and because *cogito ergo sum*.

#### Status


Project folder structure
------------------------

This project has been structured using this [rr-init repository] as a template.
In order to keep an upstream to such project, add it as remote like this:

```
git remote add rr-initUPS git@github.com:massich/rr-init.git
```

### Structure Description
```
    project
    |- doc/                  # documentation for the study
    |  |- paper/             # manuscript(s), whether generated or not
    |  +- source/            # sphinx source
    |
    |- data                  # raw and primary data, are not changed once created
    |  |- raw/               # raw data, will not be altered
    |  +- clean/             # cleaned data, will not be altered once created
    |
    |- results               # all output from workflows and analyses
    |  |- figures/           # graphs, likely designated for manuscript figures
    |  +- pictures/          # diagrams, images, and other non-graph graphics
    |
    |- scratch/              # temporary files that can be safely deleted or lost
    |- src/                  # any programmatic code
    |
    |- datapackage.json      # metadata for the (input and output) data files
    |- requirements.txt      # list of the required packages (see virtualenv)
    |
    |- LICENSE.md
    |- README.md             # the top level description of content

### Recomendations

#### Use a virtual environment (Virtualenv + VirtualenvWrapper)

Virtual-environments are not **virtual machines**.
Virtual-environments are used to avoid library classing between the libraries of a project and those fom the system.
Find more information in this [virtual environment post] describing how to use virtual environment for a [mozilla marketplace testing].

Use the following to create a `myPyProject` environment based on the `./requirements.txt` associated with the source directory `./src`:

```
mkvirtualenv myPyProject -a src -r ../requirements.txt
```

Notice that `mkvirtualenv` activates such environment.
The command `deactivate` is used to exit the virtual environment.
Once the virtual environment exist on the system, the command `workon myPyProject` is rather convenient since it jumps into the working directory and activates the virtual enviroment.

**Remember** to keep `requirements.txt` up to date.
For more details regarding the usage of the virtual enviroment, please look at the [command reference].
